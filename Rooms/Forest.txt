Maybe there is something to eat here?\n\nSquaaaackk!\n\nYou hear the scream of a large bird as it swoops over your head towards one of the bushes and begins to nibble on something in the bush then it soars away. Your stomach starts to rumble and you realize it has been sometime since you have had a meal. Seems like this bird had the right idea. Make sure the bird isn’t coming back before you start to check out that bush though.",
