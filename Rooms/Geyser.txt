    "long_intro": "As you walk into a slightly mars-like landscape a thick fog begins to surround the area. Suddenly a hot stream of water erupts into the sky and it starts to smell a bit like rotten eggs. Ah, this must be Terror Trail’s famous Geyser. Known for its steamy tower of water and stinky mist, people will travel long distances to see this sight.\n\nIt is getting quite late, however, and no one else is here to help but maybe there is something around that could help with finding the way out? There is a small wooden object over closer to the Geyser, might be worth getting a little closer to check it out. Don’t get too close though, that steam is HOT!",
    "short_intro": "You definitely are back at the Geyser as that no one can forget that rotten egg sound. Are you getting close to escaping?",
