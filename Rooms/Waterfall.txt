You’ve stumbled upon a waterfall, it must be at least 500 ft tall! The crashing of the waterfall is so loud, it’s hard to hear what’s going on around you, and a thick layer of moisture is coming from the misty pool at the bottom.\n\nYou take a couple of steps to try to get your bearings… woahh! All of the rocks are slick. There looks to be an opening behind the waterfall that could provide some shelter.",
    "short_intro": "The now familiar rushing sound accompanied by a thick mist surrounds you. You’ve found your way back to the waterfall. The visibility has only gotten worse from earlier, but you feel more comfortable here as you work your way across the slick landscape.",
