The crashing of the waterfall is so loud, it’s hard to hear what’s going on around you, on top of the heavy layer of mist where the falls meet the bottom.\n\nYou take a couple of steps to try to get your bearings… woahh! All of the rocks are slick. Best not to stay here too long, you try to look around for how to safely get away from here.",
    "short_intro": "The now familiar rushing sound accompanied by a thick mist surrounds you. You’ve found your way back to the waterfall. The visibility has only gotten worse from earlier, but you feel more comfortable here as you work your way across the slick landscape.",
